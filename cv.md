## SUMMARY
__Hi there!__ Iâ€™m a final-year student in __Information Technology__. My main specialization is Local Area Network Design. Now I am deep in the study of front-end development. I like the process of creating website interfaces. And I want to develop in this direction. __Web development is my passion.__ I already have some experience in front-end. I have built several small projects for local and foreign clients, and I continue to develop my skills in creating websites using modern __CSS__ preprocessors, also __JavaScript__ libraries and frameworks.

Now I am looking for opportunity to realize my skills and get new experience.

## SAMPLE CODE
How it works. [Function onclick to open modal window with image zoom from gallery](https://ggvloerbekleding.be/#gallery)
```javascript
const modal = document.getElementById('myModal');
let currentImage = document.querySelectorAll('.gallery_iner img');
let thumbs	= document.querySelectorAll('.gallery_items div');
let img = document.querySelector('.gallery_iner');
let modalImg = document.getElementById('img');

[].forEach.call(thumbs, function(thumb, n) {
		thumb.index = n;
		thumb.addEventListener('click', function() {
			modal.style.display = 'block';
  			modalImg.src = currentImage[n].src;
		})
	});

let modalContent = document.getElementsByClassName('modal-content')[0];

modalContent.onclick = function() {
  modal.style.display = "none";
};
```

## EXPERIENCE
__I have completed several projects successfully as a student.__

I developed web pages such companies as RTV EURO and ING Bank for "Absolvent Talent Days 2019" in Warsaw.  I used @media queries for mobile, hover and parallax effects, basic JavaScript for validation of forms . Sample code can be viewed on the [GitHub](https://github.com/boriskrasko).

As freelancer I added an auto [dark mode](https://ihelper.by/) to some web pages using JavaScript.

I have optimized some client sites for mobile with Bootstrap 4. I have also used my experience to get high results in Google Page Speed and Gmetrix for early created projects.
